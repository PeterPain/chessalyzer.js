Has two different banks for heat map comparison Type: Array.&lt;Array&gt; gameProcessor :GameProcessor Does the analysis part Type: GameProcessor Methods generateComparisonHeatmap(square, fun [, bank1] [, bank2]) Generates a comparison heatmap out of the tracked data. There needs to data in both banks you pass as bank1 and bank2 params. The heatmap for both banks are calculated and then the relative differences between both banks are calculated. For example, if the heatmap value for &quot;a1&quot; of bank1 is 10 and the value of bank2 is 5, the returned value for &quot;a1&quot; would be 100% ([[10/5] -1] *100). Parameters: Name Type Argument Default Description square String The square the data shall be generated for. fun function The evaluation function that generates the heatmap out of the saved data. See Chessalyzer#generateHeatmap for a more detailed description. bank1 Number &lt;optional&gt; 0 Bank number of dataset 1 bank2 Number &lt;optional&gt; 1 Bank number of dataset 2 Returns: Array with 3 entries: 8x8 Array containing the heat map values for each tile The minimum value in the heatmap. The maximum value in the heatmap. Type Array generateHeatmap(bank, square, fun) Generates a heatmap out of the tracked data. Parameters: Name Type Description bank Number Path the analysis file shall be loaded from square String The square the data shall be generated for. For example, if you wanted to know how often a specific piece was on a specific tile, you would pass the identifiert of the tile to the function, e.g. &quot;a2&quot; fun function The evaluation function that generates the heatmap out of the saved data. This function gets passed the following arguments: The complete data stored in the chosen bank. See the member description of the dataStore member to see which data is available. The coords of the tile passed as the square argument. The current coordinates of the tile the data should be generated for. The function must return a Number with the heat map value for the square passed as the third argument. See ./src/exampleHeatmapConfig for examples of such a function. Returns: Array with 3 entries: 8x8 Array containing the heat map values for each tile The minimum value in the heatmap. The maximum value in the heatmap.

Every number of processed games an event is emitted containing the current number of processed games. The event can be handled via &quot;chessalyzer.gameProcessor.on('status', function(gameCnt) {// do handling here});&quot;, e.g. to update an UI.

Automatically handles the events 'move', 'take', 'en passant', 'castle' and 'promote'. Use this function instead of ChessBoard.processMove() to input a move to the board! Parameters: Name Type Description moveData Object Properties Name Type Description moves Array.&lt;Object&gt; An array containing up to 2 moves in the syntax {from: [], to: []} takes Boolean True if the move takes a piece promotes String Type of promoted piece in case of pawn promotion, else null printPosition() Prints the current board position to the console. promotePiece(coords, pieceType) Promotes a pawn to a piece. Parameters: Name Type Description coords Array.&lt;Number&gt; An array containing the row and column of the pawn to be promoted. pieceType String Target piece type in SAN notation ('N', 'B', 'Q', 'R'). reset() Resets the board to the default state: removes promoted pieces and puts the standard pieces back to their starting positions. Does not reset the stats recorded. If you wish to reset the stats, call ChessBoard#resetStats. resetStats() Resets the stats recorded. updateTileStats() Is called after each ChessBoard#move to record the stats for the ChessTiles.
